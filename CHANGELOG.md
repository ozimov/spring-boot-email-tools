### Changed
- Large refactoring of packages.

    better interaction with persistence service (now having it own thread).

## [0.4.2] - 2017-02-21
### Added
- More examples with scheduling and persistence.
- New config key for REDIS settings `spring.mail.scheduler.persistence.redis.settings`.

## [0.4.1] - 2017-02-14
### Added
- The property to enable the `SchedulerService` class is the boolean one `spring.mail.scheduler.enabled`.

    class `PriorityQueueSchedulerService` is required on if `spring.mail.scheduler.enabled=true`.
- The main properties in `application.properties` required by the extension are now hardcoded 
    in class `ApplicationPropertiesConstants`.

### Changed
- The `SchedulerService` is not enabled by default anymore, it needs to be activated via `application.properties`.
- The `PersistenceService` is becomes enabled if the proper properties are provided plus if the `SchedulerService` 
    is enabled as well.
- The application properties `spring.mail.persistence.*` are now renamed into `spring.mail.scheduler.persistence.*`, 
    since they can work only with the scheduler.
- The application properties `spring.mail.scheduler.persistenceLayer.*` are now renamed into `spring.mail.scheduler.persistence.*`.

## [0.4.0] - 2017-02-08

 the package containing these classes has been renamed from `impl` to `defaultimpl`.
